I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Cornell University. My research focuses on developing statistical methods to understand complex dependence structures in data arising in biology, neuroscience, finance, and other disciplines. I primarily work on statistical machine learning approaches involving time series analysis, graphical models, high-dimensional inference, optimization techniques, and causal inference.

Currently, I am actively working on:
1. Developing fast, implementable coordinate descent algorithms for statistical optimization problems in the frequency domain time series. 
2. Designing methods for counterfactual estimation and forecasting in panel data with dynamic latent structures.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Statistics from Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata.
