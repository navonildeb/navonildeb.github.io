I am a fifth year PhD student in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Cornell University. I am interested in developing statistical methods to understand complex dependence structure in data arising in biology, neuroscience, finance and other disciplines. My research involve statistical machine learning methods involving time series, graphical models, high dimensional methods, optimization techniques and causal inference. Currently I am actively working in two areas: 

(1) Developing fast and implementable coordinate-descent based algorithms for statistical optimization problems in Fourier domain, 
(2) Counterfactual estimation and forecasting for panel data with dynamic latent structures. 

Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Statistics from Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata.

I am looking for postdoctorate positions starting Fall 2026.
