I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of [Statistics and Data Science](https://stat.cornell.edu/) at [Bowers School of Computating and Information Science, Cornell University](https://bowers.cornell.edu/). I work in [Statistical Modeling of Compex Systems Lab](https://smocs.stat.cornell.edu/) where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Sumanta Basu](https://sumbose.stat.cornell.edu/). I also closely collaborate with [Prof. Raaz Dweivedi](https://raazdwivedi.github.io/) at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/). Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Statistics at [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/).

My research primarily focuses on developing statistical methodologies for analyzing complex, high-dimensional, and temporally dependent data. Such data—-arising in neuroscience, finance, policy evaluation, and many other domains—-exhibit intricate temporal and cross-sectional dependencies that challenge traditional methods for estimation, inference, and forecasting. I aim to make these dependencies learnable through statistically principled methodologies with theoretical guarantees and by building scalable algorithms. Broadly, my work bridges **Time-sereis Analysis**, **High-dimensional Statistics**, and **Causal Inference**, with the following specific directions:

* Spectral-Domain Graphical Modeling
* Scalable Optimization Methods for High-Dimensional Problems
* Forecasting Counterfactuals in Panel Data

I additionally pursue interdisciplinary research on building predictive models for the body weight of endangered rhinoceroses using morphological data in small-sample settings, in collaboration with [Prof. Rovin Radcliffe](https://wildlife.cornell.edu/people/robin-radcliffe) at [College of Veterenary Medicine, Cornell University](https://www.vet.cornell.edu/). My research and publications can be found [here](https://navonildeb.github.io//publications/).

I am actively looking for academic jobs in **Fall 2025**, and happy to connect if you are aware of any openings.
