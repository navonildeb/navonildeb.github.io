I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of [Statistics and Data Science](https://stat.cornell.edu/) at [Bowers School of Computating and Information Science, Cornell University](https://bowers.cornell.edu/). I work in [Statistical Modeling of Compex Systems Lab](https://smocs.stat.cornell.edu/) where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Sumanta Basu](https://sumbose.stat.cornell.edu/). I also closely collaborate with [Prof. Raaz Dweivedi](https://raazdwivedi.github.io/) at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/). Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Statistics at [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/).

My research primarily focuses on developing statistical methodologies for analyzing complex, high-dimensional and dependent data. Such data—-arising in neuroscience, finance, policy evaluation, and many other domains—-exhibit intricate temporal and cross-sectional dependencies that challenge traditional methods for estimation, inference, and forecasting. I aim to make these dependencies learnable through statistically principled methodologies with theoretical guarantees and by building scalable algorithms. Broadly, my work bridges **Time-sereis Analysis**, **High-dimensional Statistics**, and **Causal Inference**, with the following specific directions:

* Graphical Modeling in Frequency Domain
* Scalable Optimization Methods for High-Dimensional Problems
* Forecasting Counterfactuals in Panel Data

I also enjoy pursuing collaboration with domain experts in other disciplines. Currently I am collaborating with [Prof. Robin Radcliffe](https://wildlife.cornell.edu/people/robin-radcliffe) at [College of Veterenary Medicine, Cornell University](https://www.vet.cornell.edu/) and [Prof. Amy Kuceyeski](https://gradschool.weill.cornell.edu/faculty/amy-kuceyeski) at [Department of Radiology](https://radiology.weill.cornell.edu/) at [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu/). My research and publications can be found [here](https://navonildeb.github.io//publications/).

I am actively looking for academic jobs in **Fall 2025**, and happy to connect if you are aware of any openings.
