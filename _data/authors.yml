  bio         : "I am a fourth year PhD student in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Cornell University. Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Statistics from Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata. I am interested in developing statistical methods to understand complex dependence structure in data arising in biology, neuroscience, finance and other disciplines. My methods involve statistical machine learning approaches involving time series methods, optimization techniques, causal inference, graphical models, high dimensional methods and spectral domain time series. Currently I am actively working in two areas: (1) developing fast and implementable coordinate-descent based algorithms for handling statistical optimization problems in Fourier domain, (2) counterfactual estimation and forecast techniques for longitudinal data with dynamic latent structures.
                Keywords: machine learning, statistical optimization, time series, causal inference, graphical models, high dimensional methods"
