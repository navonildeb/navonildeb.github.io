## Research Interests

* Time series
* Graphical models
* Causal inference under dynamics in panel data
* Optimization in high dimension

## Pre-prints

* **Regularized estimation of sparse spectral precision matrices (2024)**

Navonil Deb, Amy Kuceyeski, Sumanta Basu

(To be submitted to *Annals of Statistics*)

Tl;dr- Developed an adaptive estimation methodology of spectral precision matrices at fixed frequency with non-asymptotic guarantees in high dimension, equipped with a fast and scalable coordinate descent estimation algorithm by leveraging the structure of complex-valued omptimization problem.

[Pre-print](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2401.11128) | [R Package](https://github.com/navonildeb/cxreg)


## Working papers

* **Counterfactual forecasting for panel data (2025)**  

Navonil Deb, Raaz Dwivedi, Sumanta Basu

Tl;dr- Developed forecast algorithms for counterfactuals in a panel data with temporally correlated latent factors and general observation patterns.

(Under review at *AISTATS 2026*)

* **Confidence intervals for high dimensional sparse spectral precision matrices** (In preparation)

Navonil Deb\*, Younghoon Kim\*, Amy Kuceyeski, Sumanta Basu (\* = equal contribution)

Tl;dr- Developed entry-wise confidence intervals for the entries of sparse spectral precision matrix of a stationary time series in high dimensions, enabling recovery of conditional graphs at a fixed frequency.

(To be submitted to *Biometrika*)
