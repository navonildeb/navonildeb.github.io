## Working papers

* **Counterfactual forecasting for panel data (2025)**  

Navonil Deb, Raaz Dwivedi, Sumanta Basu

Tl;dr- Developed forecast algorithms for counterfactuals in a panel data with temporally correlated latent factors and general observation patterns.

(Under review at *AISTATS 2026*)

* **Confidence intervals for high dimensional sparse spectral precision matrices** (In preparation)

Navonil Deb\*, Younghoon Kim\*, Amy Kuceyeski, Sumanta Basu (\* = equal contribution)

Tl;dr- Developed entry-wise confidence intervals for the entries of sparse spectral precision matrix of a stationary time series in high dimensions, enabling recovery of conditional graphs at a fixed frequency.

(To be submitted to *Biometrika*)


## Older Pre-prints
