  TL;DR – In multivariate time series, conditional dependence structure among different components are captured by spectral precision matrices. Instances in neuroscience captures the functional connectivity of fMRI brain rhythms within certain frequency-band and generated from different brain regions. We develop an adaptive method to estimate spectral precision matrices at any frequency. Our work adjusts for heterogeneity in scale across time series components, provides theoretical error guarantees in high dimensions, and introduces a fast, scalable coordinate-descent algorithm tailored to the complex-valued setting.

## Working papers

* <span style="font-weight:bold">Counterfactual forecasting for panel data (2025)</span><br>
  <span style="color:#555">Navonil Deb, Raaz Dwivedi, Sumanta Basu</span><br>
  <em>(Under review at AISTATS 2026)</em><br>
  <small>
  TL;DR – In mobile health studies, subjects’s responses depend not only on treatments but also on their past behavior. We design a flexible forecasting method that leverages these temporal patterns in latent factors to accurately forecast unobserved (counterfactual) outcomes in panel data.

  TL;DR – Developed entry-wise confidence intervals for the entries of sparse spectral precision matrices of a stationary time series in high dimensions, enabling recovery of conditional graphs at a fixed frequency.

## Selected Earlier Works

* <span style="font-weight:bold">Finding optimal cancer treatment using Markov decision process to improve overall health and quality of life (2020)</span><br>
  <span style="color:#555">Navonil Deb, Abhinandan Dalal, Gopal Krishna Basak</span><br>
  <small>
  TL;DR – Cancer care isn’t one-size-fits-all. A young patient might prioritize aggressive recovery, while an older one might value comfort. This work proposes a Markov-decision-process framework that addresses the heterogeneity among treatement adopters and is equipped to tailor treatment decisions by balancing medical factors with each patient’s personal preferences.
